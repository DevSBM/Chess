blocking checks
	- Blocking check is possible only against bishop, rook, or queen checks.
	- Double check means blocking is impossible—the king must move.

    The ONLY case where capture is possible in double check—when the king itself captures one of the attackers and is no longer under attack

- Knight and pawn checks cannot be blocked, only captured or escaped.


Steps to Check if a Piece Can Block a Check
Identify the Attacking Piece

Find the enemy piece that is checking the king.

Determine the Check Path

If the attack is from a bishop, rook, or queen, their movement follows a straight line.

The squares between the attacking piece and the king form the "attack path".

Find Pieces That Can Move to the Attack Path

Check if any friendly piece (except the king) can move to a square in the attack path.

This piece should have a legal move that places it on one of those squares.

Ensure No Other Rules Prevent the Block

The blocking piece must not be pinned to its own king.

The move should be legal (e.g. a pawn cannot move to an unreachable square)



checkmate
	- king in check
	- king can't be moved
	- no pieces to block check
	- no pieces to capture attacking piece
stalemate
	- king not in check
	- no other legal moves

promotion

Once checked -> Calculate all the valid moves and capturable moves -> If there is no move for any piece its checkmate -> If its not a check & still there are no moves for any piece then its a stalemate

If checked -> store all the checking paths of checking pieces in their respective classes -> Filter valid moves with the help of this checking path of the checking pieces

Remember:
	Blocking check is possible only against bishop, rook, or queen checks.
	Double check means blocking is impossible—the king must move.
	a piece can only block check if its not already pinned
